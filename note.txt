DONE:
1. move to (1598, 758)
2. right click at 1598, 758
3. left click at (1578, 792)
4. right click at (2019, 713)
5. move to (1995, 771)
6. left click at (1995, 771)
7. add quit program hotkey (Ctrl+s)
8. change to relative positioning
-> find_window(title = "OSBuddy Guest - Guest")
-> implement the function in get_xy and its inverse in move_click
2. approximate color detection!
-> abs(xa - xb) + abs(ya - yb) + abs(za - zb)
    1. capture a screenshot
    1.5: get the width and height
    2. loop through all pixels in the image
    3. for each pixel, compare its distance to the color parameter (which you already have - it's named "color"),
    and see whether that distance is less than the tolerance.
6. try FindWindow (not FindWindowEx)


TODO:

4. image detection (find and click on "Drop" word)
5. login functionality (enter pw + click "play")
7. fixed time wait:
    1. random time wait (e.g. 5-10 seconds)
    2. wait until a condition is satisfied
    3. wait up to some time limit, or until a condition is satisfied (i.e. combination of 2 + 3)
8. find_color_spiral (searches for colors from the center of the screen and going radially outward)
9. check_attack_text check_text_color (hover over an attackable NPC -> yellow text on top-left corner of the screen
-> attackable NPC)
10. find_color_random (find_colors + choose a random pixel, not necessarily the first one found)
11. find_color_patch (find a region with the same color) (the largest such region)


NOTE TO "change to relative positioning":
i. find python.exe
ii. change file properties
iii. compatibility tab
iv. change high DPI
v. override high DPI scaling behaviour. (scaling performed by: application)
