# OSRS Automation
Old School RuneScape is a video game populated in early 2010s. The game is set in a virtual dynamic environment.
This program creates a bot in attempt to automate the game for better user experience; specifically, for saving players' precious time. >:)
## Purpose:
Due to the great amount of repetitive tasks existing in Old School Runescape's game mechanics, players are expected to manually accomplish those tedious actions, such as chopping down trees, fishing, or mining, in order to level up those skills. The goal of this bot is to help the player to speed up those tasks by enabling them to multitask with other things in their life (i.e. player will be able to AKF), while the bot will do those tasks for them; so long as the game is running in the background. As of now, this bot is capable of attacking certain NPCs for automatic combat training (More attacking targets can be easily added if you just follow the same structure format.) and mining (includes silver, gold, and copper mines).

## How to run the program:
